# ANLY502 - Massive Data Fundamentals<br>Lab: Hadoop, HDFS, Amazon Elastic MapReduce<br>February 5, 2018

## Start an Amazon EMR Cluster

1. Start an Amazon Elastic MapReduce (EMR) Cluster using Quickstart with the follwing setup (as shown in the picture):
	*  Give the cluster a name that is meaningful to you
	*  Use Release `emr-5.11.1`
	*  Select the first option under Applications
	*  Select 1 master and 2 core nodes, using `m4.large` instance types
	*  Select your correct EC2 keypair or you will not be able to connect to the cluster
	*  Click **Create Cluster**

	<img src='images/emr-02-create-cluster-quick-options.png'><br>
	As soon as you create the cluster, you will see the cluster in "Starting" mode:
	
	<img src='images/emr-03-cluster-starting.png'>	

2. **You only need to do this once:** Once the cluster is in "Waiting" mode, click on the **Security Groups for Master** which will take you to the Security Group configuration page, and add port 22 like you did in the homework Tutorial (Follow next three screenshots)

	<img src='images/emr-06-add-ssh.png'><br>
	
	
## SSH Into the Cluster

```
ssh hadoop@[[master-node-dns-name]]
```
Note the usernanme is **`hadoop`**. Get your cluster's master node IP address from the Cluster console.

You will see something like this:

```

## Create your own S3 Bucket

You will create an S3 bucket of your own. EMR clusters can read/write data from the cluster's HDFS as well as S3 buckets. Remember, your HDFS storage gets deleted when you shut down a cluster. If you want to keep data files, you can save them to S3.

**Make sure your region is N. Virgina**

1. Go to the S3 Console
	<img src='images/s3-01-service.png'><br>
	
2. Click "Create Bucket"	
	<img src='images/s3-02-create-bucket.png'><br>

3. Enter a **globally unique bucket name.** Use a combination of letters, dashes and numbers. This name must me unique across all S3 buckets on Amazon. After the first screen, you can keep the defaults. Click Next 3 times and then "Create Bucket".
	<img src='images/s3-03-name-bucket.png'><br>


## Run some HDFS commands

The reference guide for all the HDFS Shell commands is here: [https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r2.7.3/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/FileSystemShell.html](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r2.7.3/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/FileSystemShell.html)

1. List files in your newly created cluster's HDFS (will be empty):
	`hdfs dfs -ls` or `hadoop fs -ls`
	
2. 	List files in a public S3 bucket owned by Prof. Vaisman, created for this course: 	`hdfs dfs -ls s3://bigdatateaching/`

	```
	[hadoop@ip-172-31-25-210 ~]$ hadoop fs -ls s3://bigdatateaching/

	[hadoop@ip-172-31-25-210 ~]$
	```
	
3. Copy a file from the course's S3 public bucket **to your personal S3 bucket**
	`hadoop fs -cp s3://bigdatateaching/shakespeare/100-0.txt s3://[[your-bucket-name]]/`

	**Note: this file exists until you delete it**

	Now you can see list the contents of **your** S3 bucket: `hadoop fs -ls s3://[[your-bucket-name]]`

4. Copy a file from the course's S3 public bucket **the cluster's HDFS**

	`hadoop fs -cp s3://bigdatateaching/shakespeare/100-0.txt ./`
	
	In the previous command, you did almost the same as in step 3. However, the destination is different. Notice that the destination **does not** have the `s3://`prefix. Anytime you use the HDFS shell commands, and the source/location do not have `s3://` you are working with the cluster's HDFS.
	
	You can now list the contents of your cluster's HDFS:
	`hadoop fs -ls`

## Run a Hadoop job

You will run a Hadoop job using a built-in example that comes with Hadoop. It is the Word Count. You will issue a command that will start the job with a specified `.jar` (Java Archive) file and pass in some parameters. You will use the `100-0.txt` file in HDFS as the input, and you will specify the output to your S3 bucket.

```
hadoop jar /usr/lib/hadoop-mapreduce/hadoop-mapreduce-examples.jar wordcount 100-0.txt s3://[[your-s3-bucket]]/shakespearewordcount
```

You should see something like this:

After the job is complete, you can see the results files in your S3 bucket:

`hadoop fs -ls s3://[[your-s3-bucket]]/`

You'll see the text file you copied earlier, and the directory created by the Hadoop job.

You can see the contents inside that directory:

Each `part-r-xxxxx` file is the result of a reduce process. 

To see the contents **inside** a file (the first 5 lines), you can use another command:

`hadoop fs -cat s3://[[your-s3-bucket]]/shakespearewordcount/part-r-00000 | head`
